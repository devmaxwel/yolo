# Explanation of Project

## Overview

This project sets up a development environment for a web application using Vagrant, Ansible, and Docker. The project consists of three main files: `inventory`, `Vagrantfile`, and `playbook.yml`.

The `inventory` file specifies the target hosts that Ansible will configure. In this case, it specifies a single host running locally in Vagrant.

The `Vagrantfile` defines the Vagrant virtual machine that will be used for development. It specifies the operating system, amount of memory and CPUs, and network settings for the VM.

The `playbook.yml` file is an Ansible playbook that configures the Vagrant VM and sets up the web application. The playbook clones the application code from a Git repository, installs Docker and Docker Compose, and starts the application using the `docker-compose.yml` file in the application's root directory.

## Steps

The following steps were taken to set up the development environment:

1. Clone the project repository to a local directory.

2. Navigate to the project directory and run `vagrant up` to start the Vagrant VM.

3. Once the VM is running, run `ansible-playbook playbook.yml` to configure the VM and set up the web application.

4. The application can be accessed in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Requirements

To use this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Git
- Vagrant
- Ansible
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Conclusion

This project provides a convenient way to set up a development environment for a web application using Vagrant, Ansible, and Docker. By following the steps outlined in this document, you should be able to quickly get up and running with your own web application.
